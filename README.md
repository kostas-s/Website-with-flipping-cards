# Website with Flipping Cards
A basic website implementation of flipping cards in CSS.
 
## This project makes use of the following:
* HTML/CSS/Google Fonts.

## Features
* 9 Cards arranged 3x3 using Flexbox
* Each card contains 3 div elements, for front,back and middle (the middle div can be removed, it was just needed for the specific project)
* Hovering over each card rotates it around the Y axis by 180 degrees and properly shows its back side.
* This is done with a transition animation and makes use of the "perspective" attribute to enhance its style.
